1)Mention the working of Internet Website in Terms of Front-end & Back-end Divisions?

Ans : An Internet web page usually consists of two main components: the front-end and the back-end. These components work together to create functional and interactive websites for users. Here's an overview of how the division's front-end and back-end work:

Front end: Front-end refers to the client side of the website that users interact with directly. It includes the website's presentation and user interface. Front-end technologies focus mainly on visual and interactive aspects. Key front-end components include: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): Defines the structure and content of web pages. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Controls the appearance and layout of web pages, including colors, fonts, and element placement. JavaScript: This is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to a web page. Enables actions such as form validation, animations, and content updates on the fly. Front-end developers are responsible for implementing these technologies to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites. They work on designing layouts, implementing UI elements, and ensuring responsiveness across multiple devices.

Backend: Back-end, also known as server-side, deals with the behind-the-scenes operations of a website that users do not directly interact with. It consists of servers, databases, and the logic that powers the web. Key back-end components include: Server-side programming languages: Common languages include Python, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript (Node.js), which are used to write the logic and functionality of a website. Web frameworks: These frameworks, such as Django (Python), Ruby on Rails (Ruby), Laravel (PHP), and Express.js (Node.js), provide ready-made libraries and tools to streamline back-end development. Database: Back-end systems use databases to store and manage data. Popular options include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQLite. API (Application Programming Interfaces): APIs enable communication and data exchange between front-end and back-end. They allow the front-end to request and receive data from the back-end and vice versa. Back-end developers are responsible for building server-side infrastructure, handling database operations, implementing business logic, and managing the interaction between front-end and back-end components.

Overall, the front-end and back-end work together to create a seamless website. The front-end takes care of presentation and user interaction, while the back-end manages data storage, processing, and business logic.

What are tags in HTML? Explain the each category of tag with an Example?
Ans : HTML tags are the keywords on a web page that define how your web browser must format and display your web page. Almost all tags contain two parts, an opening, and a closing tag. For example, is the opening tag and is the closing tag. There are two kinds of HTML tags: paired and unpaired. Paired tags require an opening tag that turns a formatting feature on and a closing tag that turns the feature off.

HTML comment Tag The HTML comment tag is used to write comments in main HTML code file.

HTML doctype Tag The Doctype declaration is used to tell the Browser about the version of HTML.

HTML Tag HTML Tag is used to define the root of HTML Document.

HTML head Tag HTML Head Tag contains the meta information about the web page.

HTML title Tag HTML title Tag is used to define title of web page.

HTML body Tag HTML body Tag is used to define the Web Page Body.

HTML headings Tag (h1 to h6) HTML Headings Tag are used to create HTML Headings.

HTML p Tag HTML p Tag defines paragraph element.

HTML br Tag HTML br Tag is used create a line break in normal flow of content.

HTML hr Tag HTML hr Tag is used to insert a horizontal rule.

Explain the working Procedure of Virtual DOM? Ans : The Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) is a concept used within web development frameworks such as React.js to improve the performance and efficiency of updating and rendering web pages. Here's an overview of how the virtual DOM works:
Initial rendering: When a web page is first loaded, or when changes are made to the page's data or state, a virtual DOM is created. It is an abstraction of the actual DOM, a representation of the structure and content of a web page.

Virtual representation of the DOM: The virtual DOM is a tree structure that mirrors the structure of the real DOM. Each node in the virtual DOM represents a corresponding node in the real DOM, including elements, attributes, and their relationships.

Updating the virtual DOM: When there is a change in the data or state of the web page, the virtual DOM is updated, rather than directly modifying the real DOM. This is a key difference and optimization over traditional DOM manipulation methods.

Difference: After the virtual DOM is updated, a process called "diffing" is performed. Differences include comparing the previous version of the virtual DOM with the updated version to determine the minimum set of changes needed to synchronize the virtual DOM with the new state.

Virtual DOM reconciliation: Once differences (or "differences") between the previous and updated virtual DOM are identified, the reconciliation process begins. Based on these differences, it calculates the most efficient way to update the actual DOM model.

Applying the changes to the actual DOM: Finally, the changes identified during the reconciliation process are applied to the actual DOM. Only the necessary modifications are made to minimize the number of actual manipulations performed on the actual DOM.

Rendering: After the changes are applied to the actual DOM, the updated web page is rendered and displayed to the user. The process of updating the virtual DOM and applying changes to the real DOM can be repeated whenever there are further updates to data or page state.

By leveraging the virtual DOM, web frameworks can optimize performance by reducing the number of expensive operations required to directly manipulate the real DOM. The virtual DOM enables efficient batch updates and intelligent rendering, resulting in a smoother user experience and better performance for complex web applications.

Mention some Differences between MySQL and No SQL ? Ans : MySQL and NoSQL are popular database management systems, but they differ in their data models and the way they handle data. Here are some key differences between MySQL (a relational database management system) and NoSQL databases:
Data model: MySQL: MySQL follows a relational data model, which means that data is organized into tables with predefined schemas. It enforces structured relationships between tables using primary keys, foreign keys, and normalization techniques. NoSQL: NoSQL databases use different data models such as key-value, document, column or graph. They offer flexibility when it comes to schema design, allowing for dynamic and unstructured data. Scheme flexibility: MySQL: MySQL databases have a predefined schema that needs to be defined before inserting data. Changing the schema requires modifying the table structure, which can be time-consuming for large databases. NoSQL: NoSQL databases provide schema flexibility. They allow for dynamic and evolving data structures, so there is no need to pre-define the schema. Data can be added without requiring a predefined structure or changing existing data. Scalability: MySQL: MySQL databases traditionally scale vertically by adding more powerful hardware resources (eg CPU, RAM) to a single server. It can handle large data sets, but the scalability of a single server has limitations. NoSQL: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers, allowing for easier scalability. They can handle large volumes of data and traffic by adding more servers to the cluster. query language: MySQL: MySQL uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to define and manipulate data. SQL provides a rich set of operations for complex querying, joining tables, and enforcing data integrity. NoSQL: NoSQL databases can use different query languages specific to their data model. Some NoSQL databases have their own query languages, while others use a simple key-value approach or document-based querying. ACID compatibility: MySQL: MySQL is a transactional database that provides ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) features. It ensures data integrity, consistency, and reliability through mechanisms such as transactions and locking. NoSQL: NoSQL databases prioritize high scalability and performance over strict ACID compliance. While some NoSQL databases offer ACID guarantees for specific operations, many NoSQL databases abandon consistency and isolation in favor of scalability and performance. It is important to note that these differences are generalized and specific database systems within the MySQL and NoSQL categories may have their own unique features and characteristics. The choice between MySQL and NoSQL depends on factors such as the nature of the data, scalability requirements, query needs, and the specific use case of the application.

Explain any one DBMS Technology in your own words? Ans : One of the popular DBMS (Database Management System) technologies is MongoDB, which is a document-oriented NoSQL database. MongoDB stores data in a flexible and scalable document format called BSON (Binary JSON), which is a binary representation of JSON-like documents.
Here's an explanation of MongoDB in my own words:

MongoDB is a database technology that enables flexible and scalable data storage and retrieval. It is classified as a NoSQL database because it breaks away from the traditional relational database model and provides a document-oriented approach.

In MongoDB, data is organized and stored in collections, which can be thought of as containers for documents. Each document is a record that consists of key-value pairs, similar to a JSON object. These documents can have different structures, allowing for dynamic and evolving data models. This flexibility makes MongoDB suitable for working with unstructured or semi-structured data.

One of the advantages of MongoDB is its scalability. It can easily distribute data across multiple servers, enabling horizontal scaling to handle large volumes of data and traffic. This makes it well suited for applications that require fast and efficient data storage and retrieval.

MongoDB also offers powerful querying capabilities. It supports a rich query language that enables complex queries, including filtering, sorting, and aggregation operations. It also provides indexing mechanisms to optimize query performance.

Another notable feature of MongoDB is its support for high availability and fault tolerance. It includes features like replication, where data is automatically copied to multiple servers to ensure redundancy and minimize the risk of data loss. In addition, MongoDB can handle failover scenarios and automatically promote a replica to the primary role if the primary server becomes unavailable.

Overall, MongoDB provides a flexible and scalable solution for data storage and management. Its document-oriented approach, scalability, powerful queries, and high availability features make it a popular choice for modern applications that work with large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.
